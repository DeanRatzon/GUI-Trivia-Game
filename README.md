# Trivia-Game
This project is a Trivia game which was created as part of the "Advanced Java Programming" course in my University studies.

*In order to change, delete or add questions , open the trivia.txt file in the project directory and use the following format:

A trivia question writing format:
1st line - question<br>
2nd line - correct answer
3rd line - answer option
4th line - answer option
5th line - answer option

For example:
What is 1+1?
2
1
4
3

Please note:
*Each question should have excatly 4 answers options.
*Different questions should have a single empty line inbetween them
*When a question loads the answers will be positioned randomly (in different locations every time) so dont worry about the correct answer writing the correct answer first everytime.
