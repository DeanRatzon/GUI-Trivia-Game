# Trivia-Game
This project is a Trivia game which was created as part of the "Advanced Java Programming" course in my University studies.

*In order to change, delete or add questions , open the trivia.txt file in the project directory and use the following format:<br>

A trivia question writing format:<br>
1st line - question<br>
2nd line - correct answer<br>
3rd line - answer option<br>
4th line - answer option<br>
5th line - answer option<br>

For example:<br>
What is 1+1?<br>
2<br>
1<br>
4<br>
3<br>

Please note:<br>
*Each question should have excatly 4 answers options.<br>
*Different questions should have a single empty line inbetween them. <br>
*When a question loads the answers will be positioned randomly (in different locations every time) so dont worry about the correct answer writing the correct answer first everytime.
